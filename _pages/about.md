Welcome to my world!

Iâ€™m currently a first-year graduate student from the Department of Automation, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China. I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jianping He](https://automation.sjtu.edu.cn/JPHE) in [IWIN-FINS Lab](https://iwin-fins.com/). I received my B.E. degree in the Department of Automation from Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China, in 2024. 

My primary research interests include geometric deep learning, graph neural networks, and generative models. Currently, I focus on integrating geometric deep learning with generative models and applying them to robotics.
